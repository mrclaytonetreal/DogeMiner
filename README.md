Pebble Watch Face for Pebble SDK2

A re-written version of github.com/johanso-au/DogeMiner, this face now works natively on Pebble V2 without the need for 3rd party applications (HTTPebble)

The watchface displays the current network statistics (Current Block, Difficulty, and Global Hashrate), along with the current DOGE/BTC price (via Cryptsy) and a DOGE > USD conversion (displayed as $X.XXX / 1000 DOGE). These details update each minute.

Download link TBA.

The API address referenced in the Javascript is my own VPS with the current information served from a MySQL database. Should any of the 3rd price API's go down, the information will continue to be updated with the last known information. Any donations to assist with the API hosting costs is greatly appreciated DOGE (DN9aMzWhRbAkFHvU8AeXt9nkm548Fersaj)

Any questions or comments welcomed.


How to install:
=======

At the time of writing (Jan 2014), the Pebble SDK2 was only available to developers and is not yet on Google Play or the Apple Store. Should you wish to use this watchface now, you will need to aquire the Pebble V2 app for your device from Pebble.

Installation is simple enough. Download the face from the link below (or from the Pebble App Store once available) from your phone with the Pebble App installed. This will automatically install the watchface and display it.
